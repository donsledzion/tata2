Second version of my "Kid's diary". From now other parents can register their accounts and create their kid's profiles.
Only chosen by parents user will be allowed to follow their diary.

Parents can register account to store their kid's funny / interesting quotes.
#################################################################################
User with parent privilages are able to
 - create kid's profiles, which include: name, surname, date of birth, default picture (avatar), short "about" section,
 - add and edit new quotes, which consists: Author (kid), Sentence, Date of quote and picture. Picture supossed to refe to the situation.
        when not any picture is not submited while posting quote, default picture is loaded.
 - invite other users to follow their kid's accounts,
 - invite relatives from outside service - via e-mail. Inviting person can "pre-fill" registration form for invited user (the only option availble at the moment). 
        Invited user needs only to click activation link recived in e-mail, and set password.        
        
 Users with guest privilages can only browse availble entries from multiple accounts.
 
 Users are able to check "relatives" status:
  - which account do I follow (everyone),
  - who follow's our kid's account (parents)

 I'm planning to add more functionalities, but propably in next "release" which is supossed to be based on REST API:
 - edition of kid's profiles (for parents),
 - sending request to allow following account (everyone)
 - comments and reaction "fb-like" system
